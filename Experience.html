	<p> In this section, i would like to share about my experience on how i survived in this Library Management course. Firstly, after SPM i got 6A's and in UPU choices most of that i choose my favourite course which is TESL. However, i did not because my English on A- only so i did not meet the requirement. Suprisingly, i got course that i did not apply at all Diploma in Library Management. So, it was hard for me and i always having difficulties in understanding the library and IT subject and i really did not like it at all. I even tried to change Uitm because i do not want to stay in this course. However, i tried my best to adapt myself</p><br>
    
	<p1> Then, i get in class KIM1201A and we become so awkward to talk to another and i just stay alone and only having close friend with my roomate. Everything was so boring and i hardly to speak and having chat to my classmates. In semester 2, i already known of my clasmates because of group assignments. I did enjoyed in semester 2 and sadly like 2 months or something we just stayed at campus before need to continue with ODL norm. That would be really disaster as i did not understand at all. Gladly i have clasmates that really understanding and always give advices and also positive vibes. I personally like my classmates character because they rarelly like to speak up but they have a lot of skills that i never have before</p1><br><br>
    
	<p2>For those people who read this, there is something good behind everything happened and you just need to go with the flow after trying. To be good and skilled person we need time and practice. If i never go to Uitm i would never meet the amazing classmates, i will never learnt about Adobe, IT, about library, how to bring ourself forward. I love everything that happened in my life and i really know God must arrange everthing to His servant perfectly. Believe in yourself and moving forward</p3><br><br>
